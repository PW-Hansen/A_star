# Testing suite

Remember name your test the same as the module you are testing, prefixing it with `test_`!

For example:
- If you have a module named `gcd.h`, create a new file called `test_gcd.c` in here.
- You will also be required to add it to `CMakeLists.txt` with the relevant linking!

For how to use MTest itself, see the examples here: https://github.com/MortenSchou/mtest
