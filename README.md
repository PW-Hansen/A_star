# P1 G16: Minefield Clearing

To clone: `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:PW-Hansen/P1_project_minefield_pathfinding.git`

### HOWTO Contribute.

This is still WIP.

1. Use `_alloc` suffix for functions that return a `malloc` or `calloc` pointer.

2. When using an `_alloc` function, always put a `free` right below it. Only move this `free` down as needed, dont put it at the bottom.
